	   	This is my first scratch activity I have done. My partner Jefferson and I remixed a maze game by changing the layout of the game and the sprites. Instead of a ball moving to a goal, it was a kid trying to cross several
	   	streets to a building.

	  This scratch remix is a part of a project where my partner Jefferson and I modified a motion capture. The goal of the game is to "smack" away the monsters to save the princess and her friends.
	  This game was made in scratch and utilizes an event handler that sense motion in the camera to call the next code.

	       This is an app that my partner Derek and I designed that helps high school students calculated GPA with weighted and unweighted classes. Featuring an amount of classes selector, listpicker for grade selected, and a weighted class option.
	       The app was made in MIT App inventor and uses listpicker, buttons, and checkbox algorithms.
